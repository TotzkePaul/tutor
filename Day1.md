# Day 1

Ten Things to know on your first day as a software dev

1. ABC: Always Be Coding! You should modify and run some code today!  
2. You aren't far behind! The industry is always changing. Most things you learn are less than 5 years old!
3. How to get an interview? Make a Portfolio of your code and build your resume with your (dev) story.
4. Once you have 6 months experience, people don't really ask for your grades or education often.
5. Reading and watching tutorials are great but don't go over board. 
6. Web Dev is choose your own adventure. If you don't like something, you can avoid it! Except JavaScript ðŸ˜‚
7. College teaches you 10% of need to be a Junior Developer and most people forget what they learned within 2 years
8. Definately learn VS Code and Extentions. I'm writing this repo in VS Code because it has a Github Markdown Preview!
9. Its ok to copy code. Its not cheating but try to understand it. Its ok to read the same api everyday but develop reflexes!
10.
