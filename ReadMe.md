# Mern Stack Tutor

~~This hypertext book for everything you need to know for your first day as a developer.~~

Master Yoda spent 20 years alone in exile on Dagobah meditating on Luke's Jedi Bootcamp training.

I'll try to make you a WebDev Jedi or DevOps Sith Master as fast as Yoda trained Luke. ðŸ˜‰ 

Worried that your behind? 
You never stop learning. Technology is always changing, so what might be good today is not tomorrow.

If you wanna stumble in the right direction, but still fall down sometimes check out YouTube Videos from Traversy Media, The Net Ninja, Academind, Programming with Mosh,  and Coding Phase.

What stack should I learn first?
MERN because you only need to learn 1 language to do all 3 major parts of web app: Front End, BackEnd and Database


What is the MERN Stack?
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

* MongoDB - javascript-based document database
* Express(.js) - Node.js  web framework
* React(.js) - a Frontend(client-side) JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

You can transition easiliy to other tech.

Learn TypeScript? Replace React for Angular to be the MEAN Stack.
Learn a different database? No problem! 
Learn nginx, iis, apache or another web server? Migrating is a little difficult but a good experience.

# Skill 1- Source Control: Git

GitHub is a coding collaboration website, that makes Git easier to use. 
The way git works is it organizes code into repositories or 'repos' which contains all the coding files for a project - kind of like a folder. 
These files are then tracked by git, which checks to see if any of them change. 
If a file changes, you can use a git tool to organize that change or a bunch of unrelated changes in different files into a 'commit' which can then be 'pushed' to a server. 
The good thing about git and GitHub is that they can be accessed from anywhere.
A typical way is for multiple people to clone the repo and work on code. 
When you collaborator pushes their changes to Github, you can get the updates by pulling them.
Git also has usernames, so you can see a history of which file changed, when, what lines changed, and who did it
